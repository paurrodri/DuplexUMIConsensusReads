## Description

`DuplexUMIConsensusReads` calls consensus reads from input reads generated from the same double-stranded DNA molecule.
These input reads are assumed to:
* be generated from paired-end sequencing 
* be generated from DNA fragments with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) attached in both ends (Duplex-UMIs).
  
The mathematical and probabilistic procedure to determine the consensus sequence is based on [fulcrumgenomics CallMolecularConsensusReads tool](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgbio/wiki/Calling-Consensus-Reads).
  
The additional feature in this tool is that the mapping information of the consensus reads is also computed. Therefore, there is no need to map the consensus reads again after using this tool.


## Installation

Download the script `DuplexUMIConsensusReads.py`

or clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/paurrodri/DuplexUMIConsensusReads.git
```


## Dependencies

`DuplexUMIConsensusReads` is dependent on Python >= 3.6. 
  
It requires the following libraries:

* sys
* argparse
* math
* random
* numpy
* pysam


## Usage

Run:
```
python3 DuplexUMIConsensusReads.py -i <inputfile.bam>
``` 

### Required arguments

The only required argument is the **input file**, given with `-i` or `--input_file`.
  
The input file is assumed to:
* be a binary Sequence Alignment/Map file (`.bam` format)
* have reads generated by paired-end sequencing, from a library with Duplex Unique Molecular Identifiers (Duplex-UMI) attached to the DNA fragments
* have the reads sorted by position
* have the Duplex-UMI sequence specified in every read, with the tag `RX`
* have the family code specified in every read, with the tag `MI`. This family code is unique for each combination of Duplex UMI sequences

The current version of `DuplexUMIConsensusReads` is recommended to be used for input files that had been processed by [fulcrumgenomics GroupReadsByUMI tool](http://fulcrumgenomics.github.io/fgbio/tools/latest/GroupReadsByUmi.html)
